Objective: create a game in which the user has to guess a number and gets alerted with the result.
The user enters and submits their guess via a form (input).
A function generates a random number between 1 and 28. An event listener is added to the submit button in the form. An "if...else if" statement allows for three outcomes: correct guess; incorrect guess by 1; incorrect guess by more than 1.
An alert message informs the user of the result.
